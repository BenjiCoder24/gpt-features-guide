# Research Workflow with GPT Features

This document provides a template for integrating GPT features into academic or corporate research workflows.

## Workflow Overview

```
Literature Review → Research Design → Data Collection → Analysis → Publication

    Web Search      Team Collaboration  Project     Task Management Sharing
```

## Phase 1: Literature Review

### Setup

1. Create a new GPT Project titled "[Research Topic] Investigation"
2. Create initial document structure:
   - Background and Context
   - Current Research Landscape
   - Identified Gaps
   - Research Questions
   - References

### Implementation

1. Use web search integration for current research:
   ```
   /search "[topic] recent research [year] [field] publication"
   ```

2. Create tasks for research team members:
   ```
   /task "Review papers on [specific aspect] by [date]"
   ```

3. Collaborative document building:
   - Team members add findings to relevant sections
   - Use comments for questions/clarifications
   - Track literature coverage with task completions

## Phase 2: Research Design

### Setup

1. Create new project documents:
   - Methodology Overview
   - Research Design
   - Variables and Measurements
   - Timeline and Resources

### Implementation

1. Use group features for collaborative design:
   - Schedule virtual design meetings
   - Document decisions in real-time
   - Track design evolution through version history
   
2. Create tasks for design components:
   ```
   /task "Define operational variables by [date]"
   /task "Develop measurement instruments by [date]"
   /task "Create data collection protocol by [date]"
   ```

3. Use web search for methodology validation:
   ```
   /search "research methodology for [approach] in [field]"
   ```

## Phase 3: Data Collection

### Setup

1. Create new project sections:
   - Data Collection Protocol
   - Raw Data Repository
   - Collection Progress Tracking
   - Quality Control Measures

### Implementation

1. Task management for data collection:
   - Create task lists for collection activities
   - Assign responsibilities to team members
   - Track completion against timeline
   
2. Document all collection procedures in shared workspace
   - Real-time updates from field teams
   - Issue logging and resolution
   - Protocol adjustments with version tracking

3. Regular team check-ins with documented outcomes
   - Progress reviews
   - Challenge identification and resolution
   - Protocol refinements

## Phase 4: Analysis

### Setup

1. Create analysis workspace:
   - Analysis Plan
   - Preliminary Findings
   - Advanced Analysis
   - Visualizations
   - Interpretation

### Implementation

1. Collaborative analysis workflow:
   - Team members assigned to specific analyses
   - Results shared through document updates
   - Comments used for interpretation discussions
   
2. Web search for analytical techniques:
   ```
   /search "statistical analysis for [data type] in [field]"
   ```
   
3. Version tracking for analysis iterations:
   - Preliminary results preserved
   - Analysis refinements documented
   - Decision points noted

## Phase 5: Publication and Dissemination

### Setup

1. Create publication workspace:
   - Draft Manuscript
   - Figures and Tables
   - Submission Requirements
   - Reviewer Feedback
   - Revision Plan

### Implementation

1. Collaborative writing process:
   - Section assignments through tasks
   - Draft consolidation in shared document
   - Review process with comments and revisions
   
2. Web search for publication outlets:
   ```
   /search "journals for [topic] research impact factor"
   ```
   
3. Task management for submission process:
   ```
   /task "Format manuscript for [journal] by [date]"
   /task "Prepare supplementary materials by [date]"
   /task "Submit to [journal] by [date]"
   ```

## Integration Points

This workflow integrates all major GPT features:
- **Projects**: Central organization for all research content
- **Groups**: Team collaboration across research phases
- **Web Search**: Literature review and methodology references
- **Tasks**: Progress tracking and responsibility assignment

## Customization Guidelines

Adapt this workflow by:
1. Adjusting phases to match your research methodology
2. Adding domain-specific document templates
3. Customizing task structures for team size
4. Incorporating field-specific web search strategies
5. Modifying publication approach based on output type
