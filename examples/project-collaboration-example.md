# Project Collaboration Example: Research Team

This example demonstrates how a research team can use GPT's project features for collaborative literature review.

## Project Setup

**Project Name:** Climate Change Mitigation Research
**Team Members:** 5 (Research Lead, 3 Researchers, 1 Data Analyst)
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Objective:** Compile and analyze recent research on urban climate change mitigation strategies

## Initial Configuration

1. Research Lead creates project with the following structure:
   - Project description outlining goals and timeline
   - Initial document sections:
     - Literature Review
     - Methodology
     - Analysis Framework
     - Findings
     - Recommendations
   - Permission settings:
     - Research Lead: Admin
     - Researchers: Editor
     - Data Analyst: Editor (limited to Analysis section)

## Workflow Implementation

### Week 1-2: Literature Gathering

1. Each researcher is assigned specific focus areas:
   - Researcher A: Transportation solutions
   - Researcher B: Building efficiency
   - Researcher C: Urban planning
   - Data Analyst: Emissions data

2. Team members use web search integration to find recent publications:
   ```
   /search "urban transportation emissions reduction studies 2022-2024 academic"
   ```

3. Researchers save relevant findings directly to the Literature Review document with source attribution

### Week 3-4: Collaborative Analysis

1. Team uses the commenting feature for initial observations:
   ```
   @ResearchLead I've found conflicting data on electric bus efficiency in cold climates - see highlighted sections
   ```

2. Weekly virtual meetings documented directly in the project space
   - Meeting notes automatically categorized and linked to relevant sections
   - Task assignments created directly from discussion points

3. Data Analyst creates visualizations and uploads directly to Analysis section

### Week 5-6: Synthesis and Review

1. Team collaboratively edits the Findings document
   - Version history tracks all contributions
   - Comments resolve methodological questions
   - Web search verifies uncertain claims

2. Research Lead provides feedback using targeted comments
   - Changes tracked with clear attribution
   - Reviewers notified of requested revisions

### Week 7-8: Final Document and Presentation

1. Team consolidates findings into final report
   - Collaborative editing refines language
   - Version history ensures no work is lost
   - Citations automatically formatted

2. Presentation materials created within project
   - Slides draw directly from report content
   - Team members provide feedback
   - Final approval tracked through task completion

## Outcome

- Comprehensive research report completed collaboratively
- Clear attribution of all contributions
- Complete documentation of research process
- Seamless integration of web research, team discussions, and analysis
- Final product reflects combined expertise of entire team

## Key Features Highlighted

- Project-based organization
- Role-based permissions
- Web search integration
- Version history tracking
- Task assignment and tracking
- Collaborative document editing
- Discussion threading and resolution
