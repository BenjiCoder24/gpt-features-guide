# Enterprise Knowledge Management with GPT

This use case demonstrates how a medium-sized technology consulting firm implemented GPT features to centralize and leverage their organizational knowledge.

## Company Profile

**Organization:** TechSolve Consulting
**Size:** 250 employees
**Structure:** 15 specialized teams across 5 service areas
**Challenge:** Knowledge silos and inefficient information sharing

## Initial Situation

TechSolve faced several challenges with knowledge management:
- Expertise was scattered across email threads, documents, and team drives
- New team members struggled to find relevant information
- Solutions to similar problems were reinvented across teams
- Valuable client insights remained in individual project documentation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Knowledge Structure Creation

1. **Project Organization**
   - Created hierarchical project structure by service area
   - Implemented standardized project templates
   - Established consistent document naming conventions

2. **Content Migration**
   - Transferred key documents to GPT projects
   - Prioritized high-value reference materials
   - Tagged content by expertise area, client industry, and technology

### Phase 2: Team Access and Collaboration

1. **Group Configuration**
   - Established team-based access groups
   - Created cross-functional knowledge-sharing groups
   - Implemented role-based permissions:
     - Service leads: Full administrative access
     - Practitioners: Edit access to relevant domains
     - Support staff: View access to applicable materials

2. **Search Enhancement**
   - Enabled web search integration for current technology trends
   - Created custom search templates for common queries
   - Implemented verification workflows for external information

### Phase 3: Task Integration

1. **Knowledge Maintenance**
   - Established regular knowledge review tasks
   - Implemented automated document update reminders
   - Created contribution tracking metrics

2. **Onboarding Integration**
   - Developed guided learning paths for new employees
   - Created task-based knowledge acquisition sequences
   - Implemented knowledge proficiency verification

## Outcome Metrics

After six months of implementation:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Time to find information | 27 min | 4 min | 85% reduction |
| Knowledge reuse rate | 32% | 78% | 46% increase |
| New hire proficiency time | 12 weeks | 5 weeks | 58% reduction |
| Weekly knowledge contributions | 8 | 47 | 487% increase |
| Cross-team collaboration | 15% | 64% | 49% increase |

## Key Success Factors

1. **Executive Sponsorship**
   - CTO championed the initiative
   - Allocated dedicated time for knowledge contribution
   - Recognized top contributors

2. **Incremental Implementation**
